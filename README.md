# Modelular

## Introduction

Modelular is a unity tool that extends the set of 3D mesh primitives available for prototyping, and that enables procedural mesh generation based on modifiers to adapt the geometry to prototyping needs.
It works both in the editor and at runtime, but lacks testing at the moment.
It is developped in my free-time, and may or may not change in the future.
You are free to use it as you wish, and I'd be happy to hear your feedbacks at the following address : antonin.delpias.faucher@gmail.com
